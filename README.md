# Terraform


Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that lets you define and manage infrastructure as code. Terraform code is written in HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) and can be used to provision and manage infrastructure on a variety of platforms, including cloud providers, on-premises data centers, and virtual machines.

Terraform works by first parsing your Terraform configuration file to create a representation of the desired state of your infrastructure. Then, Terraform compares the desired state to the current state of your infrastructure and determines the changes that need to be made. Finally, Terraform executes the necessary changes to bring your infrastructure into the desired state.

**Terraform has a number of benefits, including:**

* Consistency: Terraform allows you to define your infrastructure in a consistent way, regardless of the underlying platform.
  
* Reproducibility: Terraform configuration files can be version controlled and shared, making it easy to reproduce your infrastructure across different environments.
  
* Safety: Terraform uses a declarative language, which means that you describe the desired state of your infrastructure, and Terraform figures out how to get there. This helps to reduce the risk of human error.
